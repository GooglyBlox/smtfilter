# r/SomebodyMakeThis Post Filter

A Chrome extension developed in response to [this Reddit request](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/1dpisc7/a_browser_extension_for_somebodymakethis/). It hides posts marked as "I made this!" without an r/SomebodyMakeThis URL in the description, preventing you from seeing posts from people promoting a product they have created rather than answering someone else's "SMT" request.
